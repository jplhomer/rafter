# Rafter üè°

**Update: Rafter is pivoting to a hosted model. This open-source code remains as a fun reference. Enjoy!**

Rafter is a serverless deployment platform powered by [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). It leverages Google Cloud Run (and many other tools) to transform your Git repository into a fully-scalable serverless application running in the cloud - with **zero configuration**.

üí∞ Scales to zero when not in use, saving you money ‚Äî perfect for hobby projects<br>
üî• Automatically scales to handle load<br>
üîå Manages, connects and creates Cloud SQL databases for your applications automatically<br>
‚ö°Ô∏è Connects to GitHub and supports deploy-on-push<br>
üöÄ Spin up multiple environments available at vanity URLs at the click of a button<br>
‚ú® No Dockerfiles required

‚ö†Ô∏è **_Rafter is still very much a work-in-progress!_** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Google Cloud Services

### Cloud Run (web service)

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/products#serverless-computing)

-   Creates services for each environment of each project, automatically
-   Cloud Run handles all traffic roll-out, scaling, and configuration
-   Environment variables are assigned to each unique service through the API

### Cloud Build (image creation)

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/)

-   Docker images are created when code is pushed to GitHub
-   Dockerfile is automatically provided based on type of project
-   Currently supported: **Laravel, Node.js**

### Cloud SQL (database)

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/)

-   Database instances are provisioned by Rafter through the API
-   Databases are created and assigned to projects automatically using the Admin API
-   Environmental variables are properly assigned based on type of project

### Cloud Firestore (cache and session drivers)

**UPDATE**: This... doesn't work great, due to a number of factors. Looking into alternatives.

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore)

-   NoSQL database to support key-value caching and session management
-   Drivers integrated automatically based on project
-   No additional credentials required for consumer apps to use, since credentials are supplied within Cloud Run

### Cloud Tasks (queue driver)

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tasks)

-   Robust queue management platform
-   Queues are automatically created for each environment
-   Dedicated Cloud Run service is created for each project to handle incoming jobs through HTTP request payloads
-   No daemon or worker instance is required
-   Since Cloud Run is serverless, instances can fan out, thousands of jobs can be processed in a matter of seconds

### Cloud Storage (image artifacts and uploads)

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage)

-   Object storage, similar to S3
-   Automatically handles uploaded artifacts from Cloud Build
-   Integrated into application helpers based on project type to handle user uploads

### Cloud Scheduler

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler)

-   Used for firing cron events in e.g. Laravel

### Cloud Logging

[Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging)

-   HTTP requests, stdout and app logs displayed inside Rafter log viewer

## Roadmap

Here are things I'd like to work on next:

-   [x] Extract laravel-rafter-core into a package
-   [ ] Inject Laravel Stackdriver log driver config
-   Support other projects:
    -   [x] Node
    -   [ ] WordPress
    -   [ ] Rails
    -   [ ] Go
    -   [ ] Custom Dockerfile
-   [ ] Email driver support (does Google offer this as part of GCP?)
-   [ ] Integration of Secret Manager
-   [x] Integration of commands
-   [ ] Integration of GCS for better uploads with Laravel
-   [ ] Better Database operations
-   [ ] Leverage GitHub Deployment API to mark when a branch has been deployed
-   Lots of UI upgrades:
    -   [x] Log viewer
    -   [ ] Database information
    -   [ ] User profile/settings
-   Better Cloud Build optimization
    -   [x] Clone using ZIP instead of Git
    -   [x] Use secrets rather than plain text tokens for security
    -   [ ] Consider adding multistage builds for Nodejs, Composer building steps
-   [ ] Implement Custom Domain assignment and onboarding
-   [ ] Implement an environment deletion workflow to delete resources/schedulers/etc
-   [ ] Allow users to clone a public project without having to connect a source provider
-   [ ] Create a CLI to allow users to push a local project without connecting a source provider

## Development notes

-   Clone it
-   Use [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/valet) to run it and connect to a local MySQL database
-   Run `make share` to fire up ngrok.io local tunnel
-   Requires grpc PHP extension to be installed locally: `pecl install grpc`

## Inspiration

-   [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/) and [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/)
-   [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
